### Repository content

* index.html: Contains all relevant code as standalone web page, relevant parts are commented
* RetailStore_sw_levels.hdr: HDRI used for shading
* Spiegltec_reduced.glb: 3D model that is rendered
* style.css: Currently only specifies the size of the rendered object, can be adapted/changed/removed as needed

In the current setup all files need to be hosted on a server in the same directory. For production use, only the relevant HTML snippets as commented in the file are necessary with the .hdr file,  .glb file, and external resources accessible to it.
